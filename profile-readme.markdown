## Profile README.md

For this task you will be creating a profile README.md file.

A profile README.md file allows you to share information about yourself with the community. GitHub will display your profile README.md at the top of your profile page.

I have created a basic example on [My GitHub Page](https://github.com/codeadamca):

> Checkout the [GitHub Profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) page for more information.
