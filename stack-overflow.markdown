## Stack Overflow

As a programmer, Stack Overflow will become one of your best resoureces!

I did not start posting questions om Stack Overflow until later in my programmer career, and I wish I had started earlier. It is an invaluable resource that can kind of be intimidating at first.

Before you post, read these resources:

1. [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) (Stack Overflow Help)
2. [Anyone else find the Stack Overflow community toxic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7szv7i/anyone_else_find_the_stack_overflow_community/) (Reddit)

The community on Stack Overflow can be harsh. Still to this day some of my questions get down voted, improperly flagged as duplicates, or suggested I shouldn't even beasking the question.

Here is a great illustration of what you can expect when posting a question:
