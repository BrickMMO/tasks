## Project Pitch

For this assignment you will choose your project topic and pitch the idea to the class.

The final project can either be a BrickMMO project or a [Useless Website](https://theuselessweb.com/).

### BrickMMO Project

In a group of one to three students you can worm on one of the proposed projects or propose your own idea. Current proposed ideas include:

- Bricker (BrickMMO Twitter)
- Events
- Flow (timesheets, questions, skills)
- Pick a Brick
- GPS
- Parts
- Website
- Brickcoin
- Panel

### Useless Website

Or you can create a [Useless Website](https://theuselessweb.com/) as an individual. Try to come up with an idea that is quirky but somewhat related to the Web Development inductry.

If done correctly this can make a great portfolio piece. I would recommend aiming for something like one of the following Useless Websites:

- [Passive Aggressive Password Machine](https://trypap.com/)
- [Koalas to the Max](https://www.koalastothemax.com/)

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Choose either a BrickMMO (groups) or Useless Website (individual) project.
2. Brainstorm your idea.
3. Complete a [Pitch Document](documents/pitch-template.docx).

   Download the [Pitch Document](documents/pitch-template.docx) and replace the template content with information regarding your project.

   Write the pitch as if another group of programmers will be coding the project.

   Include the project purpose, descriptions of front-end and back-end, and any API endpoints.

4. Prepare a two minute pitch presentation to present to the class.

## Submitting this Task

Submit a PDF copy of your pitch and your clide deck to the **Project Pitch** assignment in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca/). You will also have two mintes to present your pitch to the class.
