## Document Conversion

For this task you will be contributing to the documentation of [BrickMMO](https://brickmmo.com/).

Many of the BrickMMO tasks require students to create PDF documents or slide decks:

- [System Hackathon](https://github.com/BrickMMO/hackathon-system)
- [Flow About](https://github.com/BrickMMO/flow-about)

We want to keep a copy of these documents in a plain text and easy to read format.

In this task you will be assigned a PDF document or slide deck and you will convert the document to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
