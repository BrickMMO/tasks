For this task you will participate in five standup meetings during the semester.

In your groups or as an individual you will have two minutes or less to provide the class with a status update on your project. You can include the following:

 - Quick update on the progress of your project
 - You can share your screen if you want to show anything
 - Current issues you are running into
 - Upcoming technological barriers
 - Plan for deployment
 - requests for feedback or help

Write a paragraph or to to track what you shared in each standup meeting. 

For example:

> Stand up #1
> This week I completed the mockups for my project. My project relies on using the GitHub API. I have coded some basic API integrations with the GitHub API and PHP. The GitHub API endpoint I am using includes user profile images, but I can't get these to load. I reached out to another student who has worked with the GitHub API before for assistance. I have also setup basic PHP/MySQL hosting where I plan to deploy this project. 

## Steps

1. During each of the five classes provide the class with a status update and any other information you want to share.
2. Document a short journal entry to track what you shared during the standup meeting. 

## Submitting this Task

Only one submission is needed per group. Submit the five standup journal entries in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca/).
