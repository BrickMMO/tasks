## Standup Meetings

For this task you will participate in standup meetings during the semester.

![Standup vs. Coding](images/meme-standup.png)

In your groups or as an individual you will have two minutes or less to provide the class with a status update on your project. You can include the following:

 - Quick update on the progress of your project
 - You can share your screen if you want to show anything
 - Current issues you are running into
 - Upcoming technological barriers
 - Plan for deployment
 - requests for feedback or help

Write a paragraph or two to track what you shared in each standup meeting. 

For example:

> **Stand Up #1**  
> This week I completed the mockups for my project. My project relies on using the GitHub API. I have coded some basic API integrations with the GitHub API and PHP. The GitHub API endpoint I am using includes user profile images, but I can't get these to load. I reached out to another student who has worked with the GitHub API before for assistance. I have also setup basic PHP/MySQL hosting where I plan to deploy this project. 

## Steps

1. During each of the two stand up meetings provide the class with a status update and any other information you want to share.
2. Document a short journal entry to track what you shared during the standup meeting. 

## Submitting this Task

There are two assignments in Blackboard for **Stand Up #1** and **Stand Up #2**. After your in person stand up meeting submit a short paragraph like the one above to these tasks in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca/).
