## Deployment

Great! You have learned lots of great languages! You can build a website! But how do you deploy that website? How do we upload our website to Internet?

By the end of the program you will want a professional domain name. I purchased my domain name ([codeadam.ca](https://codeadam.ca)) from [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/). And a hosting service (I use the [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)). But for now, let's deploy a website using a variety of free services.

For this task you will create a basic one page website using HTML and CSS with a few details about you:

You will then deploy this website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Infinity Free Hosting](https://www.infinityfree.com/).

### GitHub

GitHub has a service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This allows you to turn any repo, branch, and folder into a live website. GitHub Pages is capable of hosting any frontend languages (Markdown, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React). It cannot host serverside languages (PHP, C#, Python) or a database (Mongo, MySQL).

By default a hosted repo will be available at `https://<HUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/`. But you can also point a custom domain name to a repo. Here are some examples of my GitHub Pages hosted websites:

- The `flow-about` repo hosted at [https://github.com/BrickMMO/flow-about](https://github.com/BrickMMO/flow-about) is available to view as a website at [https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/](https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/)
- The `tasks` repo (this repo) is hosted at [https://github.com/BrickMMO/tasks](https://github.com/BrickMMO/tasks) is available to view at the custom domain [https://tasks.brickmmo.com/](https://tasks.brickmmo.com/)

> You can find out more about GitHub Page at  
> [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

There are detailed instructions on deploying an HTML website using GitHub pages in my [github-pages-deploy-html](https://github.com/codeadamca/github-pages-deploy-html) repo.

For this task you will create a repo named `about-me` and deploy a basic HTML and CSS one page website with details about you.

### Infinity Free Hosting

There are many free hosting services available. But remember, youuu get what you pay for!

I have had a good experience with [Infinity Free Hosting](https://www.infinityfree.com/) and [000WebHost](https://www.000webhost.com/).

For this task you will create a free account with Infinity Free and upload your  `about-me` website to Infinity Free.

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Create a repo named `about-me`.
2. Create basic `README.md` and `.gitignore` files for this repo,
3. Clone this repo to your computer.
4. Create a basic HTML webpage about you named `index.html`.
5. Add details about you to the `index.html` page.
6. Connect your HTML to a CSS file names `styles.css` and add a few basic styles.
7. Add, commit, and push your updates to your repo.
8. Using GitHub Pages make this webpage available at `https://<HUB_USERNAME>.github.io/about-me/`.

   > Mine is available on GitHub Pages at  
   > [https://codeadamca.github.io/about-me/](https://codeadamca.github.io/about-me/)

9. Using Infinity Free Hosting make this page available at `http://<SOMETHING>.epizy.com/about-me`.

   > Mine is available on Infinity Free at  
   > [http://codeadam.epizy.com/about-me](http://codeadam.epizy.com/about-me)
