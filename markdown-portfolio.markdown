## Markdown Portfolio

Your portflio may be the most important asset when you start your internship and job hunnt. I have attempted to set a good example and keep my portfolio quite current:

Along with my digital presence:

[<img src="images/screenshot-instagram.png" width="150">](https://www.instagram.com/codeadamca/)

You will likely code a few portfolios while you are completing this program. This first one will be coded using only Markdown. It will give you a chance to focus on your portfolio content. Write short to-the-point content, create consistent hihg quality images, and collect your online digital assets. 

## Markdown Examples

Here are a few BrickMMO websites that use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). These will give you an idea as to what is possible using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can also view their public GitHub repos to view their code.
