## Markdown Portfolio

Your portflio may be the most important asset when you start your internship and job hunt. I have attempted to set a good example regardig portfolio:

Along with my digital presence:

[<img src="images/screenshot-instagram.png" width="150">](https://www.instagram.com/codeadamca/)

You will likely code a few portfolios while you are completing this program. This first one will be coded using only Markdown. It will give you a chance to focus on your portfolio content. Write short to-the-point content, create consistent high quality images, and collect your online digital assets. 

## Markdown Examples

Here are a few BrickMMO websites that use Markdown. These will give you an idea as to what is possible using Markdown. ou can also view their public GitHub repos to view their code.
