## Markdown Portfolio

Your portflio may be the most important asset when you start your internship and job hunt. I have attempted to set a good example regardig portfolio:

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker]() on your computer.
2. Setup a basic LAMP stack. I would recommend the following using the [8.3.4-apache](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/php/8.3.4-apache/images/sha256-f83c7e0de36dea6fbd6885dea315b312e340d91017b5d4cfb3626b6c9ede3092) image.
3. Next install MySQL. I would recommend using the [latest](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/mysql/latest/images/sha256-eeabfa5cd6a2091bf35eb9eae6ae48aab8231fd760f5a61cd0129df454333b1d) image.
4. Finally setup phpmyadmin, I would recommend using the [latest](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/phpmyadmin/latest/images/sha256-687c0abcc3bb2b813fb6a033cf6a1d1df61ae61d21628e6074856553e02b9582?context=explore) image.
5. Get all three images working together to display database content in a web page using PHP.
