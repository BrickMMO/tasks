## Digital Presence

Your digital presence may play an important role when you start your internship and job hunt. I have attempted to set a good example and keep my lone presence:

[<img src="images/screenshot-instagram.png" width="150">](https://www.instagram.com/codeadamca/)

I also aim to keep some consistencey between my digital presence and my online portfolio:

Consider the following when designing your online presence:

1. Domain Name
2. Name (your name, a nickname, etc...)
3. A brand (logo, colours, etc...)

Here are the images I use for my onilne presence:
