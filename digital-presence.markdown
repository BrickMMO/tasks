## Digital Presence

Your digital presence may play an important role when you start your internship and job hunt. I have attempted to set a good example and keep my online presence up to date and consistent:

[<img src="images/screenshot-instagram.png" width="150">](https://www.instagram.com/codeadamca/)

I also aim to keep some consistency between my digital presence and my online portfolio:

Consider the following when designing your online presence:

1. Domain Name (codeadam.ca) and Account Names (codeadamca)
2. You Name (your name, a nickname, business name, etc...)
3. Brand (logo, colours, etc...)

Here are the images I use for my online presence:

<img src="images/presence-logo.png" height="200"> <img src="images/presence-profile.jpg" height="200">

I have a series of images I use for all my professional online assets and a different series for all my personal assets.

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Design a brand for your online presence.
2. Create profile and/or banner images.
3. Determine which online assets will be utilized for your online presence. I use my prtfolio, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/).
4. Apply brand to all online assets.

## Submitting this Task
