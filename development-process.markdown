## Development Process

For the [Documentation](documentat-conversion) and [Project](project) task, you will need to work with the [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) tool.

Each development company will have their own way of staying organized. These are basic instructions as to how we stay organized at BrickMMO.

1. You and your group will be assigned an asset to work on. This could be:

   **The official BrickMMO website:**  
   URL: [https://brickmmo.com](https://brickmmo.com)  
   GitHub: [https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v2](https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v2)

   **BrickMMO Flow (our internal project management software):**  
   URL: [BrickMMO Flow](https://flow.brickmmo.com)  
   GitHub: [https://github.com/BrickMMO/flow-v1](https://github.com/BrickMMO/flow-v1)

   **The About Radio documentation:**  
   URL: [https://brickmmo.github.io/radio-about/](https://brickmmo.github.io/radio-about/)  
   GitHub: [https://github.com/BrickMMO/radio-about](https://github.com/BrickMMO/radio-about)

   Locate the repo for the assigned asset. For example, let's work on the official BrickMMO website, we will need to find the [website-v2](https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v2) repo:

   ![BrickMMO Website Repo](images/screenshot-repo.png)

2. You will also be assigned a project. On the [website-v2](https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v2) repo, click on the [Website Content](https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v2/projects) project:

   ![BrickMMO Content](images/screenshot-repo-projects.png)

3. Now we select an item/issue to work on:

   ![Commissions Page](images/screenshot-project-items.png)

   We are going to work on the [commissions](https://github.com/orgs/BrickMMO/projects/17?pane=issue&itemId=40617861) item:

   ![Commissions Page](images/screenshot-item-details.png)

   And click on the `open in new tab` link to get the full item details:

   ![Item New Tab](images/screenshot-item-new-tab.png)

4. From the new tab you can assign the task to yourself (or group members).

5. Then you can click the `Create a Branch` link. This will create a new branch using the item name and number:

   ![New Branch](images/screenshot-create-branch.png)

   Click on the `Create Branch` button and GitHub will create the branch for you and provide you with code to recreate and checkout the branch locally:

   ![Copy New Branch](images/screenshot-copy-new-branch.png)

6. At this point you can open your code IDE, start making changes, and `add`, `commit`, and `push` as you normally would.

7. When you are done all of your changes, do one last `add`, `commit`, and `push`, and then proceed to the repo and submit a pull request:
