## Coding Exercises

During this course we will participate in **Coding from Scratch** exercises. These exercises will require you to code a simple common task using vanilla JavaScript. The plan for this semester is to code the following concepts:

1. Accordion
2. Slideshow
3. Monty Hall
4. API Integration

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. In class (or following a class recording) complete the Coding from Scratch exercises.
2. Deploy the exercises to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or a hosting service (Infinity Free).

## Submitting this Task

After you have completed all four coding from scratch exercises, submit four URLs to deployed copies of the code in the **Coding from Scratch** assignment in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca/).
