## README.md

Every GitHub repository you create should have a README.md. This file should tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

> Checkout the [GitHub About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) page for more information.

README.md files are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). It will be the easiest language you learn in this program.

> Checkout the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for a reference. 

## Examples
