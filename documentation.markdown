## Documentation

Part of this project will require that you create (or provide instructions for creating) some documentation for your [BrickMMO](https://brickmmo.com/) project or [Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/) contribution.

## BrickMMO

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are completing a BrickMMO related project you **NOT** be creating the actual documentation. You will be providing instructions and content for first semester students to complete your documentation.

All [BrickMMO](https://brickmmo.com/) projects include documentation using an [About Website](https://github.com/BrickMMO/template-about-markdown). These websites track what work was done during each version and who contributed. These pages can be linked to in student portfolios to document their contributions.

Using the [about-template-markdown](https://github.com/BrickMMO/template-about-markdown) and [flow-about](https://github.com/BrickMMO/flow-about) as a guide, create the content and instructions for first semester students to complete the documentation for your project.

Depending on your project, the instructions will include one of the following:

1. For a brand new project, you will need to create a new About Website. You may need to have your instructor make a new repository in the BrickMMO organization. You will need to complete these tasks:

   - Have your instructor create a new About Website repo for your project.
   - Copy over the [about-template-markdown](https://github.com/BrickMMO/template-about-markdown).
   - Modify the home page with an accurate description of your project.
   - Create a new page for the first version, include a description and a list of contributors.
   - Add a link to the first version page on the home page.

2. For a new version of an existing application you will need to add a new page for the new version and add the appropriate link on the About Website home page.

   - Create a new page for the new version.
   - Add a description of the new version and a list of contributors.
   - Add a link on the home page to the new version page.

3. If you are simply adding a new feature to an existing version, you will only need to modify the existing version page.

   - Modify the version description on the version page to include your new feature.
   - Add any new contributors.

There is a project in the [BrickMMO](https://github.com/BrickMMO) GitHub account with a project named `Documentation <SEMESTER> <YEAR>`, for example `Documentation Winter 2024`. Create a new item within this project named `Documentation for <PROJECT_NAME>-<VERSION>`, for example `Documentation for website-v3`. Put the instructions inside this new item.

Also reach out to your instructor if you need any repos created for either the project, or the about website.

## Useless Web

If you are creating a Useless Web contribution, you will need to create a repository for your project and a README.md file with the following details:

    - A descrption of the project.
    - A list of the technologies the project uses (HTML, JavaScript, React, etc...).
    - A link to the deployed website.

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Create the required documentation based on your project.
2. Deploy the documentation to your GitHub account or the BrickMMO GitHub account.
3. Submit a working URL.

## Submitting this Task

After you have completed your documentation, submit a URL to the **Documentation** assignment in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca/).
